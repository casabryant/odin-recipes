        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This chicken Parmesan starts out with frozen breaded chicken fillets. It only takes a handful of ingredients and dinner is ready in less than 30 minutes. Perfect for a college dorm meal if you only have an air fryer and a portable hot plate to cook on.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon salt </li>
            <li>2 fully cooked breaded chicken fillets (such as Kirkwood)</li>
            <li>1/2 (8 ounce) can marinara sauce</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh basil, cut in very thin strips</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, set 2 chicken fillets into the air fryer basket.</li>
            <li>Air fry chicken fillets for 6 minutes. Flip fillets over and cook for 6 minutes on the other side. Spread marinara sauce over fillets. Top each fillet with mozzarella slices. Air fry until cheese is melted, about 3 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain spaghetti noodles and divide noodles between 2 bowls. Carefully add a chicken fillet to each bowl. Garnish with basil.</li>
        </ol>
